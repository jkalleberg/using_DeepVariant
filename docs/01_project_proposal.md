# Textbook Project Proposal
    * Title of the project
    * Abstract of the research (what is the research question being asked)
    * Source of the data (Please try to find the original source of the data)
        * Name
        * Short Description
        * URL of the website
        * URL of the data to download
    * Brief overview of the workflow
        * I use this software, I transform the data this way… everything that would go into the paper’s methods
        * Write as you code: explain what you are trying to accomplish with this project as you are coding
        * Takes longer, but you end up with a done project and a done paper 
            * May end up with way more paper than needed, but much easier to cut
    * Brief overview of the analysis (tools used) or study (scalability study, parameter sweep, sensitivity study etc.) and what you wish to accomplish

Goal: Complete Project
* Data used should be similar to the real data used for the research
* You need to be able to verify that you got the right answer(s)
* Computation is "text book example", meaning data/code doesn’t have to make sense right now, but you should be able to describe how the solution changes
* At the end, Jenna will just git clone —> setup —> run, so make sure your work is reproducible!
